This program will be able to determine wether getting payed a $100 a day for ten days is better than
recieveing 1$ on the first then doubling it everyday.  
Function will calculate the amount for the first option
Function2 will calculate the amount for the second option

function1 will output 100 * 10 days
Function 2 will loop 10 times,with each time doubling the amount and then add the amount to the total.
